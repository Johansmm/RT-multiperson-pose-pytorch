Several studies have been developed in order to generate these estimates in real time using various techniques of Deep Learning. In this Notebook we study the development done in [[1]](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ezproxy.imt-atlantique.fr/document/8099626), which makes use of Part Affinity Fields for this purpose.\n","\n","Inferring the pose of multiple people in images, especially socially engaged individuals, presents a unique set of challenges. First, each image may contain an unknown number of people that can occur at any position or scale. Second, interactions between people induce complex spatial interference, due to contact, occlusion, and limb articulations, making association of parts difficult. Third, runtime complexity tends to grow with the number of people in the image, making realtime performance a challenge.\n","\n","In [[1]](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ezproxy.imt-atlantique.fr/document/8099626), a method for estimating the posture of various persons at multiple public reference points is presented. It uses the ascending representation of association scores through the part affinity fields (PAF), a set of 2D vector fields that encode the location and orientation of the limbs over the image domain. These bottom-up representations of detection and association are simultaneously inferred and encode the global context of the scene."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"faXg6vkalZ_L"},"source":["First, we will download the repository that we copied from the original repository in order to make some changes for educational purposes.
